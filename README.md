#### By _**Jackson Meyer**_

## Description

_The purpose of this application is to demonstrate that we can produce a working API GET request and draw information from the objects returned.  This is week one's intermediate javaScript independent project. Styling isnt a focus, but logic and seperation of power and package management is more the focus of this project_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _To see the working project please clone the file from my github, it can be found here: https://github.com/meyerjac/github-api_
* _navigate to the my folder and open it in a text editor such as atom or sublime_
* _then in your terminal, navigate into the top level of the project and run npm install, this will install all the necessary packages and package managers that are running my code_
* _run gulp build in the terminal, and run gulp serve which will start a server for your code and it will open the index in a web browser _
* _ANYTHING ELSE TO SAYYYYYYYYYYYYYSDFYSDFSDFK>SFD<MS><DFMNS<>DMFN<>SNF><NF<>SND<MDMS<>FN<>SMM<>DFN<>SMFD<>MF<>MS<>_

_I am using my own unique API key, if you want to plug in your github API key you can just get once from your github account_

## Known Bugs

_Bugs: at this point, it isnt overriding existing lists of repos, I hope to get to that, everytime you enter a new username, it will erase the existing repo list. also if a username doens't exist I want to spit out a message, at this point it isnt clear that it doesnt exist._
