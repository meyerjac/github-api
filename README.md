# _Github API project_

#### _This app displays a Github API, October 14th 2016_

#### By _**Jackson Meyer**_

## Description

_The purpose of this application is to demonstrate that we can produce a working API GET request and draw information from the objects returned.  This is week one's intermediate javaScript independent project. Styling isn't a focus, but logic and separation of power and package management is more the focus of this project_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _To see the working project please clone the file from my github, it can be found here: https://github.com/meyerjac/github-api_

* _You will need to get an API key from github, go to your github(or create  a profile), go to setting and generate a access a token, take that key and plug it into a .env file at the top of my folder:  e.g apiKey = "b007f56453a660eb2f3a1e744d61ff52e0c2fb7a"_
* _navigate to the my folder and open it in a text editor such as atom or sublime_
* _then in your terminal, navigate into the top level of the project and run $ npm install, this will install all the necessary packages and package managers that are running my code, then  $ bower install_
* _run  $ gulp build in the terminal, and run $ gulp serve which will start a server for your code and it will open the index in a web browser_
* _then just enter a github username in the text entry and it will spit out some info about that username, Enjoy!_
_I am using my own unique API key, if you want to plug in your github API key you can just get once from your github account_

## Known Bugs

_Bugs: If a username doens't exist I want to spit out a message, at this point it isn't clear that it doesn't exist._
